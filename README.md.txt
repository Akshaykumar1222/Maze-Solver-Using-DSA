# Maze Solver Using DSA

This project solves mazes using **DFS, BFS, A\***, and **Dijkstra's Algorithm**.  
It demonstrates pathfinding techniques and compares their performance.

## Contents
- **MazeSolver.java**: Main program with four algorithms.
- **screenshots/**: Maze images and path visualization.

## Features
- Supports multiple algorithms for solving mazes.
- Visual representation of shortest paths.
- Easy to extend with new algorithms.

## Usage
Compile and run the program:

javac MazeSolver.java
java MazeSolver

lua
Copy
Edit
Choose your preferred algorithm and view the path output in the console.
